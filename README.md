# CS-230-Final-Project
Final project for the SNHU course Operating Platforms, CS 230

### 1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room had an existing Android application. They wanted to expand the game by creating applications for additional operating platforms.

### 2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did well in identifying the design constraints and summarizing the goal of development in the Executive Summary.

### 3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It was helpful to draw diagrams of the structure of a given module. Writing pseudocode was also useful.

### 4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think my technical knowledge of various operating systems is limited, and this was reflectted in my Evaluations and Recommendations section. It would require a lot more study and research to be more well-informed when writing these sections, or I would consult with someone experienced in this area (if this was work for an actual job).

### 5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs are the primary consideration when designing anything (or they should be). I considered how users wanted to have a similar experience, regardless of platform, so one requirement was for all applications to have the same functionality and a similar "feel".

### 6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Not applicable, since I only designed and coded small pieces of already designed modules? In general, I aimed to write the simplest solution, knowing that this would be more mantainable if/when functionality changed/expanded. In similar projects, I would aim for simplicity and the use of familiar, well-tested design patterns.
